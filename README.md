## **Rebuilding Miliano-eWallet Back-End Solution: A Strategic Approach**

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for rebuilding the Miliano-eWallet back-end solution. Our primary focus is to establish a robust, scalable, and secure foundation that aligns with evolving business needs and industry best practices.

**1\. In-depth Assessment and Planning**

- **Evaluation:** We will conduct a thorough analysis of the current system to identify areas for improvement and potential shortcomings.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** We will collaborate closely with the business team to gain a deep understanding of their current and future requirements, as well as any regulatory compliance considerations.
- **Project Definition:** We will establish clear project objectives, timelines, and budgetary constraints.
- **Team Assembly:** A cross-functional team will be assembled, comprised of developers, designers, and domain experts to ensure a holistic approach.

**2\. Technology Stack Selection**

- **Technology Selection Criteria:** We will prioritize the selection of technologies that promote scalability, data security, and system performance.
- **Microservices Architecture:** We will evaluate the feasibility of implementing a microservices architecture to facilitate modular development and independent deployment of functionalities.
- **Cloud Adoption:** Cloud-based solutions will be explored to enhance elasticity, disaster recovery, and ongoing maintenance.
- **Language and Database Selection:** Programming languages and databases will be chosen based on project requirements, team expertise, and existing infrastructure compatibility.

**3\. Agile Development Methodology**

- **Iterative Development:** We will adopt an iterative development approach, delivering features in short cycles and incorporating continuous feedback for improvements.
- **Daily Stand-up Meetings:** Daily meetings will be conducted to ensure transparency, identify roadblocks, and promote collaborative problem-solving.
- **Sprint Planning and Retrospectives:** Work will be divided into manageable sprints, followed by review sessions to assess progress and identify areas for optimization.
- **Prioritization:** Feature prioritization will be based on business value and criticality to user needs.

**4\. Architectural Design and Implementation**

- **Scalable Architecture:** The architecture will be designed to accommodate future growth and increased user traffic.
- **Security Best Practices:** Robust security measures will be implemented to safeguard sensitive user data and ensure system integrity.
- **API Integration:** The system will be designed to integrate seamlessly with other applications using standardized API protocols.
- **Code Testing:** A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented to ensure code quality, functionality, and adherence to security best practices.

**5\. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**

- **Automation:** Automated tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions will be employed to streamline the build, test, and deployment processes, minimizing manual intervention and errors.
- **Deployment Strategy:** A low-risk deployment strategy will be implemented to minimize downtime and rollback capabilities will be established in case of unforeseen issues.

**6\. Performance Optimization and Monitoring**

- **Performance Benchmarking:** The system will be rigorously tested to identify performance bottlenecks and implement optimizations for enhanced speed and responsiveness.
- **Scalability Testing:** Load testing will be conducted to simulate real-world usage scenarios and ensure the system can handle peak traffic.
- **Proactive Monitoring:** Proactive monitoring strategies will be employed to identify and address potential issues before they impact user experience.
- **Monitoring Tools:** Tools like Prometheus and Grafana will be utilized to gain real-time insights into system health and performance metrics.

**7\. Documentation and Knowledge Transfer**

- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Meticulous documentation will be created to capture system design, functionalities, and operational procedures.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Knowledge-sharing sessions will be conducted to foster team collaboration and ensure a collective understanding of the system.
- **Continuous Learning:** We will cultivate a culture of continuous learning by promoting code reviews, exploring innovative ideas, and fostering a collaborative problem-solving environment.

**8\. Pilot Deployment and User Feedback**

- **Controlled Rollout:** The new system will be piloted with a limited group of users to gather feedback and identify any usability issues.
- **User Feedback Integration:** User feedback will be actively solicited and incorporated into the development process to refine the system before a wider rollout.

**9\. Full-Scale Deployment and Post-Launch Support**

- **Phased Rollout:** The system will be gradually rolled out to the entire user base in a controlled manner to mitigate risks.
- **User Training and Support:** User training materials and support channels will be established to assist users with the transition to the new system.
- **Post-Launch Maintenance:** Ongoing maintenance and support will be provided to address emerging issues, incorporate enhancements, and ensure the system's long-term stability and performance.

By adhering to this comprehensive strategy, we are confident in delivering a robust, secure, and scalable back-end solution that empowers Miliano-eWallet to thrive in the ever-evolving digital payments landscape.

Sure, here's a README file to guide users on how to run the application:

# Miliano E-Wallet Application

This is a README file to guide you on how to run the Miliano E-Wallet application.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Node.js (version 20.10.0): [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- pnpm (package manager): [Install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CYIMANA-Faisal/miliano-e-wallet.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd miliano-e-wallet
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables you can take a look at the .sample.env file

Make sure to replace `your-postgres-username` and `your-postgres-root-password` with your PostgreSQL credentials.

4. Install project dependencies using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Start the PostgreSQL database:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. Build and start the application:

   ```bash
   docker-compose
   ```

3. The application should now be running. You can access it at `http://localhost:6000`.

## Stopping the Application

To stop the application and remove containers, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
